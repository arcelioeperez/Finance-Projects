**Compound Interest Formula - Code in C++**    

> A = Pe<sup>rt</sup>  

This program uses references and vectors instead of pointers and arrays --
initially it was done this way (using pointers and arrays), but I decided to change it to make it more
compatible with C++.  

Using arrays and pointers is allowed in C++, but it is more of
a C implementation.  

Variables:     
A = end amount    
P = principal amount    
e = Euler constant   
r = rate of growth   
t = time period    

```python
#compile with clang++ or g++
g++ compound_interest.cpp -o ci

#run 
./ci 
```  

**Compound Interest Formula- Code in C**    

Uses pointers and arrays.  

```python 
#compile with clang or gcc
gcc compound_interest.c -lm 

#run 
./a.out
```
