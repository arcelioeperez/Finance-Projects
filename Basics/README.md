**Basics of Financial Statements**


Three Statements:  
- Cash Flow  
- Balance Sheet  
- Income Statement  

**Balance Sheet:**    
snapshot of the assets, liabilities, and shareholder's equity  
do we owe more/less than what we have?  

ASSETS (OWN) - LIABILITIES (OWE) = EQUITY  

good if equity is growing year after year  
working capital = current assets - current liabilities  

**current assets/liabilities:** could be turned into cash in a year/are due in a year  
2:1 is a good ratio working capital  

Equity growth could be used to figure out the true **growth rate** of the company  

**Income Statement:**    
are we profitable/not-profitable?  
sales/revenue - money you collect  
  - red flags:  
	1. growth revenue growing and growth income decreasing -- sales growth rate (revenue) and earnings growth rate (net income)  

**Cash Flow:**    
do we have enough cash?  
takes the net income/net loss from the income statement  
  - red flags:  
	1. operating cash flow or cash flow from operations is less than net income
	   or negative -- losing cash going forward    
	2. financing cash section (borrowing money, selling stock, paying
	   dividends, etc) - bad if the company **borrows** money to pay for loan
	   interests, dividends, or buying back their stock
